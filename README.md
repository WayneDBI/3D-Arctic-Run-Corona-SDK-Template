A template which demonstrates a 3D technique; with objects and actors getting larger as they come towards you. Recreate many forward running games like Space Harrier, Zombie Chase and Haunted Woods. This template shows you how to recreate this superb effect, simply and efficiently.

As the enemies and rocks etc move down the screen they appear to get bigger, simply tap the LEFT or RIGHT side of the screen to avoid the baddies. Collect as many fish as you can to increase your score.
